## Generate a CRUD API with Proxy Design Pattern in Python

I need you to generate a simple CRUD API for managing product data using the Proxy Design Pattern to connect to a SQLite database.

**Requirements:**

* The API should have basic CRUD functions: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete` for product data.
* Use SQLite as the database.
* Create a Proxy class to handle database connection, transaction management, and authorization.
* The API should have error handling.
* The API should have clear documentation and be easy to use.

## Generate Test Cases

Please generate a set of Test Cases that achieve 100% Statement Coverage for the CRUD API code using the Proxy Design Pattern for managing product data in SQLite (which was generated from the previous prompt).

**Requirements:**

* Test Cases should cover all parts of the CRUD API code.
* Include tests for the create, read, update, delete, connect, execute, close functions, and others.
* Test scenarios should include both normal cases and error cases (e.g., invalid data, database connection failures).

**Desired Output:**

* A set of Test Cases that achieve 100% Statement Coverage.
* Examples of how to run the Test Cases.
* Results of running the Test Cases.
