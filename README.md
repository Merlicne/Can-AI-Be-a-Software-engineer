# Can-AI-Be-a-Software-engineer
This repository explores the potential of AI in software engineering by attempting to fully automate the generation of source code for a complete software project. The experiment will utilize AI models to handle all aspects of software development, from coding to testing, to determine whether AI can independently function as a software engineer.
