This repository is dedicated to an experimental project that explores the potential of AI in software engineering. The primary goal is to determine whether AI can autonomously generate and validate software by taking on two critical roles:

## Project Objectives

1. **Automated Code Generation**  
   The AI will generate source code based on a set of predefined requirements. This process simulates the role of a software engineer, transforming requirements into functional software.

2. **Automated Testing**  
   The AI will also be responsible for creating and executing tests to ensure that the software meets quality standards before it is released to customers. This step ensures that the generated software is reliable and free of defects.

## Purpose

By combining these two roles—code generation and quality assurance—this project aims to assess the feasibility of AI managing the entire software development lifecycle, from initial coding to final testing.

## Remark

- The project is part of a coures on Software quality assurance of College of Computing at Khon Kaen University.
