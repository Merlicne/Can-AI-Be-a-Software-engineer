Mini Project: Pluggable Authentication System Using the Strategy Design Pattern in Java

Objective: Implement a pluggable authentication system in Java using the Strategy Design Pattern. This system should allow easy switching between different authentication mechanisms: Basic Authentication, Session-Based Authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication, and API Key Authentication. Each strategy will be encapsulated in its own class and interchangeable within the application.

Project Requirements:
Basic Authentication Strategy

Description: Implement a Basic Authentication strategy where the client sends a username and password with every request using the HTTP Authorization header.
Details:
Verify the credentials on each request by decoding the Base64-encoded username and password.
Authenticate the user by comparing against a predefined set of users.
Session-Based Authentication Strategy

Description: Create a session-based authentication system where the server generates a session ID upon successful login.
Details:
The session ID should be stored on the server side (e.g., in-memory storage, database) and returned to the client as a cookie.
The client must include the session cookie in subsequent requests to maintain the authenticated state.
Validate each request by checking the session ID against the stored session on the server.
JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication Strategy

Description: Implement a stateless JWT authentication system.
Details:
Generate a signed JWT token after successful login and send it to the client.
The client must include the token in the Authorization header with each request.
On each request, validate the token by verifying its signature and ensuring it has not expired.
API Key Authentication Strategy

Description: Implement API Key Authentication where each user is assigned a unique API key.
Details:
The client must include this API key in the Authorization header or as a query parameter with every request.
On the server side, verify the keyâ€™s validity against stored API keys in the database or memory.
Guidelines:
Design:

Use the Strategy Design Pattern to decouple the authentication mechanisms from the main application logic.
The Authenticator interface should define a common method (e.g., authenticate(request)), which will be implemented by each authentication strategy.
The main application should be able to switch between different authentication strategies without modifying its core logic.
Testing:

Write unit tests to verify each authentication strategy.
Ensure proper exception handling for invalid authentication attempts.
